---

## ⭐ Key KPIs Covered

### **1️⃣ Volume Sold on Deal (VSOD)**  
Measures how much of the total volume is driven by promotional activity.

**Formula:**  
VSOD % = Volume Sales (Promo) / Total Volume Sales


**YoY Change:**  
VSOD YoY (pp) = VSOD(Current Year) - VSOD(Last Year)


---

### **2️⃣ Promo Depth %**  
Indicates the depth of discount by comparing Promo Price vs Non-Promo Price.

**Formula:**  
Promo Depth % = (Non-Promo Price – Promo Price) / Non-Promo Price


Where:  
AUP = Value Sales / Volume Sales


**YoY Change:**  
Promo Depth YoY = Promo Depth - Promo Depth_YA


---

### **3️⃣ Promo Price ($/KG)**  
Average price consumers pay during promotional periods.

**Formula:**  
Promo Price = Promo Revenue / Promo Volume


**YoY Change:**  
Promo Price YoY % = (Promo Price - Promo Price_YA) / Promo Price_YA


---

### **4️⃣ Non-Promo Price ($/KG)**  
Everyday shelf price — a core brand health indicator.

**Formula:**  
Non-Promo Price = Non-Promo Revenue / Non-Promo Volume

**YoY Change:**  
Non-Promo Price YoY % = {Non-Promo Price - Non-Promo Price _YA} / Non-Promo Price_YA
